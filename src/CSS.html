    <h1> CSS - Designing Language Of Website </h1>
    <p> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and 
        layout of HTML documents. It allows web developers to separate content from design, making
     it easier to maintain and style web pages consistently. With CSS, you can define the look and 
     feel of a website, including colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and responsiveness, ensuring
      a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. 
 One of the core features of CSS is the ability to apply styles across multiple pages by 
linking a single external stylesheet, promoting code reusability and easier updates. CSS 
supports a variety of layout techniques such as Flexbox, Grid, and media queries, which help 
create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Modern CSS also includes 
animation capabilities and variables, giving developers powerful tools to enhance user experiences and 
streamline design workflows. </p>
