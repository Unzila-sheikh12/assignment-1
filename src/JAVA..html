    <H1> JAVA - Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) </H1>
    <p> Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 
        1995 and now maintained by Oracle. It is known for its portability, meaning that code 
        written in Java can run on any device equipped with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making 
        it platform-independent. Java follows the principle of "write once, run 
        anywhere" (WORA), which has contributed to its widespread use across various platforms, 
        including desktop applications, mobile apps (especially Android), web applications, 
        and enterprise-level systems.One of Java's key strengths is its robust ecosystem, which 
        includes a vast standard library and numerous frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, and 
        JavaFX. These tools simplify development and make Java suitable for building scalable, 
        secure, and high-performance applications. Java's strong memory management, automatic garbage 
        collection, and emphasis on backward compatibility have made it a reliable choice for 
        developers worldwide. Additionally, the large and active Java community ensures continued 
        support, regular updates, and a wealth of resources for learners and professionals alike.

    <h2> Principles Of Java </h2>
There were five primary goals in creating the Java language
<ol>
<li> It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar. </li>
<li> It must be robust and secure. </li>
<li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
<li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
<li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
</ol>
